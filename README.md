<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

**Note:** This README specifically pertains to the frontend of the project. Enclosed in this repository is the source code for the Birds of a Feather forum's frontend. Crafted for the CVWO summer project, it signifies the culmination of approximately two months of delving into web development, starting from ground zero and evolving continuously since the end of last semester's exams.

**Forum Theme:** The central theme of the forum revolves around birds as I own two budgerigars, and I love birds! The forum is called "Birds of a Feather" as birds of a feather flock together.

I hope you enjoy this website!
